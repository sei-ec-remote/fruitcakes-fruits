# Fruitcakes Full CRUD Full Stack App

- Use Express to build a server
- Use Mongoose to communicate with mongoDB
- Full CRUD functionality on our fruits resource
- User Authentication
- The ability to add comments to fruits
- (Maybe gather data from a 3rd party API)

This app will start as an API, that receives requests and sends JSON responses, but eventually we will add a views layer that will render html in our browser.
